Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis

Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, trends, and factors affecting passenger survival.
The analysis includes data inspection, visualization, and interpretation of key variables such as gender, passenger class, age, and fare.

Objective
Understand dataset structure and missing values
Explore relationships between features and survival
Identify important factors influencing survival rate
Present insights using visualizations

Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
Titanic dataset (train.csv)
Source: Kaggle Titanic dataset

EDA Steps Performed
Data loading and preview
Data information and statistics
df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()
Data visualization:
Survival count
Survival by gender
Survival by passenger class
Age distribution
Correlation heatmap
Observations written after each visualization

Key Insights
More passengers died than survived in the disaster
Female passengers had higher survival rates than males
1st class passengers survived more than 2nd and 3rd class
Most passengers were aged between 20–40 years
Passenger class and fare had strong influence on survival

Final Conclusion
Gender significantly impacted survival
Higher class passengers had better survival chances
Age and fare played important roles in survival probability
